## Whoami

I am readme for your test task.

### What to do?

I am going to create super load testing code, but it would be nothing without your help.
So I need you to do following things:
1. Create fastapi server
2. I need to access following endpoints:

    2.1 /call - with GET Request

    2.2 /call_me - with POST Request with body {'my_number': '+380000000001'}

3. I need to install and run it fast - so, please, provide steps how to do this.
4. I need to know that this server works fine after every codee change, so maybe you will add some api tests for this server ?
5. I need to create new json out of attached json, only with following fields: Patient Last Name, Patient First Name, Patient DOB, Patient Phone, Patient Alt Phone.


### ETA
You have 7days....

joking.

You have 1 day.
